*DESCRIPTION*:

It is a python project in which we are visualizing the current weather data from Mumbai and presenting it in a easy way and in visual format.

The data is fetch using "get_weather" function.It checks in OpenWeatherMap's website for The city named "Mumbai" and for API KEY and gives the data if it satisfy the following. Its more like making API request then retriving data in JSON format. I have also implemented try and exception for error handeling if ir fails to fetch the data due to some error.
Once connected it requests for weather related data like temperature,humidity,etc.This fetched data is presented in a neat and clean manner where we can understand it by visualizing it.The code generates Colorful barplots to differ it from the different parameters we are comparing.It is possible due to powerful python libraries like "MATPLOTLIB" and "SEABORN".
Each comparision parameter for weather i have used different colors for example green for current temperature,blue for min temperature and red for max temperature.This helps to distinguish between different parameters at a glance.
The data fetched is represented in a presentable manner with clear x-axis and y-axis labeling with a legend.Theres a Title to the plot.

*BREIFING ABOUT MATPLOTLIB AND SEABORN*:

Matplotlib is like foundation of plotting in python. It provides elementary objects like axes and labeling and its great for creating basic and complex plots like scatter and histograms.
Seaborn is build on top of Matplotlib for statistical data visualization.It gives high level and beautiful fonts to plot.Its used for quick and elegant statistical visualization with minimal code.

*OUTPUT*:
